>To begin using the Iris Dataset Analysis ShinyApp you must first launch the ShinyApp.

>Then to compare variables against each other choose a variable from the drop down menu of the 'First Variable' and a variable from the drop down menu of the 'Second Variable' to compare the variables against each other.
 
>Then a graph will populate the data of the variables that were compared against each other.
 
>Each species is color coded in the graph displayed to distinguish between each of the three species.
